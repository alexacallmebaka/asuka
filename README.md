# Asuka

Asuka is a Discord bot that consists of a bunch of random functionality I felt like adding.
This project was mostly just a playground for me to try some new things, and create something fun for
my friends and I to play around with. Currently, her features are:

* A basic [Cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) clone
* Bullying civil engineers
* Sharing top articles from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
* Quotes from Kevin (If you know, you know)
* Numerical integration using the midpoint rule
* Dot product of two vectors
* Cross product of two three-dimensional vectors
